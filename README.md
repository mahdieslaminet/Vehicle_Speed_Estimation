Video-Based Vehicle Speed Estimation Using Speed Measurement Metrics
Vehicle Speed Estimation
Introduction
This project aims to estimate vehicle speeds using video-based techniques and deep learning methods. By leveraging state-of-the-art models, we aim to achieve high accuracy in speed measurement, which is crucial for traffic monitoring and management.
Objectives
•	Develop a robust vehicle speed estimation system using deep learning.
•	Minimize errors in speed measurement by addressing environmental and calibration factors.
•	Provide a comprehensive dataset and implementation details to ensure reproducibility and ease of use.
Dataset
The dataset includes videos collected from various highway scenes, with annotations for vehicle speeds. Key considerations for the dataset:
•	Variety of lighting conditions
•	Different vehicle types and sizes
•	Multiple camera angles
Methodology
Deep Learning Model
We employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction, followed by a regression model to estimate vehicle speeds. The model is trained on the annotated dataset to learn the correlation between visual features and vehicle speeds.
Error Correction
To improve measurement accuracy, we implement robust calibration procedures and compensate for environmental factors such as varying lighting conditions and camera angles. These steps are crucial to minimize errors and enhance the reliability of the speed estimation system.
